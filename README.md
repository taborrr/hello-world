I am editing and updating this readme to now have a few things about myself
this will essentially act as a self-bioblurb 
My name is Tabor and I have many *hobbies* and **interests** as well as `self attributes`
##### *hobbies* & **interests**
* thrill based, creative based, athetlic based, relaxing based
* one favorite in each base is race cars, photo design, weight lifting, and movies
##### `self attributes` 
* perfectionist and makes great day-to-day to-do lists

I end with a current list of my future areas of interest
##### future areas of interest
* combining biology and technology
  * website or storefront company to customize and order a GM plant with natural ecosystem backed attributes to fit in the homeowners biome with a fair species richness and evenness 
  * hiking trail in a large scale isolated biome acreage outfitted entirely with GMOs including plants and animals, most importanly no biting insects 
  * GM plants designed for 2 life phases: space travel and mars/moon surface
* climate solutions
  * GM prokaryotes or plantae designed for carbon capture or sequestration

This is a considerably briefed blurb about me and although highlights relevant info it does not mention many other prominent interests, hobbies, attributes, and ideas
